* # Emergency Landing Gear System

- Development of a hardware prototype of an Emergency Landing Gear System, integrating an Arduino microcontroller with an ultrasonic sensor for altitude detection and a servo motor for precise mechanical actuation.  
- Developed and programmed the core control logic in Arduino to process real-time sensor data, enabling the system to autonomously trigger a time-sensitive deployment and retraction sequence.  
- Successfully simulated and validated a full-cycle emergency deployment scenario, demonstrating the practical application of embedded systems in creating a reliable, safety-critical aviation solution.
